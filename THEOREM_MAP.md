# Theorem map and trust boundary

> **Live status — 2026-09-20.** This file is a high-level trust map, not a complete index of every imported module. The authoritative maintained Lean branch is `master`; exact-head hard Lake builds and theorem-local source audits control promotion.
>
> Historical workflow-level green badges from before the repaired hard Lake gates are not verification evidence. Current promoted claims below cite exact module/aggregate runs recorded in `PROJECT_UPDATES/HANDOFF_2026-09-09.md` and QIprojects `docs/lean_status.md`.

## Current maintained baseline

Maintained reasoner head after PR #14:

`29c4d5946f427dfdfd5b9adccca242f0118f6742`.

Latest promoted Lean source verification head:

`df4466a9e5b773db105bb1fcbd14945129d2a33b`.

GitHub Actions run `34390385283` passed placeholder rejection, the three QI-D nested-upper modules and full `lake build FormalResearch` on that exact source tree before merge.

## Status vocabulary

- `FORMALIZED`: Lean source exists.
- `MODULE-GREEN`: the theorem-local hard Lake build passed at an exact source head.
- `AGGREGATE-GREEN`: full `lake build FormalResearch` passed at an exact source head containing the theorem.
- `MERGED`: reviewed source is on `master`.
- `EXTERNAL`: a named mathematical/source premise remains intentionally outside current Lean coverage.

Compilation is not by itself a specification audit. A checked theorem may be narrower than, conditional relative to, or semantically different from the surrounding source theorem.

## Blaschke quartic charge gap

Lean files:

- `FormalResearch/Blaschke/QuarticChargeGapAlgebra.lean`;
- `FormalResearch/Blaschke/QuarticChargeGapReconstructionBridge.lean`.

Current formal core includes the corrected quartic conic/factor algebra, sign chain, squared-gap defect, exact scalar reconstruction prefactor and final unsquaring to the `1/2` gap under explicit reconstruction/analytic hypotheses.

PR #8 hard verification: head `1dc24e93c1483782dd80b162c9b48cd26707fc41`, run `34336956345`, module and full aggregate green; merged.

Status: **FORMALIZED / MODULE-GREEN / AGGREGATE-GREEN / MERGED** for the conditional scalar bridge.

External boundary: raw CAS reconstruction derivation, Bessel/Gram input, Schur-domain theorem, Möbius normalization, residue/Hilbert-metric construction and confluent continuity. Do not describe the complete analytic quartic proof as internally Lean-derived.

## QI-A

The maintained aggregate contains the older four-qubit/chirality/three-copy infrastructure plus the new exact certificate layers:

### Three-copy local-Schur overhead

Lean file: `FormalResearch/QIA/ThreeCopyLocalSchurOverhead.lean`.

PR #9 verification head `2e15ff34467c5de1a2432c6d6bd7c5c7ddad19ed`, run `34339736666`, module and aggregate green; merged.

Lean proves the finite `S3` character identities `6K=L`, `6K=L+3`, and `6K=L+2` in the source regimes.

### Information hierarchy coefficients

Lean file: `FormalResearch/QIA/InformationHierarchyCoefficients.lean`.

PR #10 verification head `3591192788ae917bb43c1f8e7102e95270258efb`, run `34347204321`, aggregate green; merged.

Lean proves the exact scalar coefficient/exponent ordering including `Q_meas,full=21/22` and `xi_meas=log(22/21)`.

External QI-A boundary: operational POVM/recovery/data-processing statements, T07 coding/query architecture, reversible coherent-width Schmidt-number/recovery lower bound and other manuscript-level theorems not represented by these scalar/character modules.

## QI-B

### Symmetric U(1) exponent gap

Lean file: `FormalResearch/QIB/U1InvariantExponentGap.lean`.

PR #11 verification head `297231d4be4780b1d091092a7d841bbbe62edb85`, run `34348733331`, aggregate green; merged.

Source: `QI-B/paper/invariant_discrimination_exponents.tex` `prop:u1`.

Lean proves the exact scalar factor-two exponent relation for the source family; the twirl/binomial/operational Chernoff derivation remains external.

### B1 apolar kernel (`FormalResearch/QIB1`)

Source: `QI-B/B1-apolar/results/apolar_finite_defect_results.tex` (`D_F = 3 d_x^2 d_y - d_y^3`), lane record `QI-B/B1-apolar/notes/STATUS_MATRIX.md`.

Lean proves, for every `d >= 3`, that the monomial-coefficient matrix of `D_F` has full row rank `d-2` over `Q` and `R`, that its kernel has dimension 3, and that over `R` the kernel is spanned by the three coherent powers at `b = 0, +-sqrt 3`. The factorization `lambda_d I - E_d = D_F^dagger R_d D_F`, `R_d > 0` and all finite-defect/Hahn row identities remain external.

### B2 Hamming/Krawtchouk phase algebra (`FormalResearch/QIB2`)

Source: `QI-B/B2-hamming/results/three_band_hamming_heat_kernel.tex`, section "Exact Hamming/Krawtchouk phase algebra" (`eq:hammingU`).

Lean proves the scalar/Boolean-cube content: Krawtchouk coefficient formula and generating function, the Bose--Mesner eigenaction on a Walsh character, the canonical gate phase `i^|T|` for every Walsh label, and the `choose d m` multiplicity of weight `m`. The two-qubit swap operators, the projectors `E_m` and the operator identity on `(C^4)^(tensor d)` remain external. `Bridges/B2BlaschkeMultiplicityRank.lean` uses `QIB2.card_WalshWeightIndex`.

### B4 late source status

QIprojects now proves the flagship (`thm:flagship` in `QI-B/paper/invariant_discrimination_exponents.tex`: `F_C = F_K = 1/2`, `xi_inv = log 2`), but the theorem itself is not formalized (QIprojects `docs/lean_status.md` records what the `QIB` modules cover). Any B4 formalization must match a proved source theorem (check `QI-B/B4-orbit-bergman/notes/CORRECTIONS.md` and `QI-B/paper/CORRECTIONS.md` first) and keep the class of each statement.

## QI-C

The maintained aggregate contains the finite-field, Gaussian and all-`L` qubit-tail chain, including:

- `FormalResearch/QIC/QubitTailDeterminants.lean`;
- `FormalResearch/QIC/GaussianNonvanishing.lean`;
- `FormalResearch/QIC/QubitTailAllLNonvanishing.lean`;
- Endpoint14/Gaussian endpoint reconstruction modules.

The canonical QI-C all-`m` tail certificate has remained source-stable through the latest audit, and these modules compile in the current aggregate.

Trust boundary: this is the determinant/nonvanishing/certificate layer. The full Jacobian/orbit-identifiability statement behind `d_loc=3` is a separate semantic theorem and must not be inferred merely from aggregate compilation.

## QI-D

### D4 finite doubly-stochastic separation certificate

Lean files:

- `FormalResearch/QID/D4DoublyStochasticCertificate.lean`;
- `FormalResearch/QID/D4DoublyStochasticDualCertificate.lean`.

PR #12 clean verification head `8a95d5ba7fb0b200dfbfb2efb4c97e3710ead8be`, run `34374566836`, both modules and full aggregate green; merged.

Internally checked finite data include `|W(D4)|=192`, orbit sizes `(8,24,8,8)`, witness value `7/6`, Weyl support, exactly `2304` finite coweight constraints with zero violations, and the exact 14-term rational dual.

External boundary: the finite-coweight characterization of semantic `DS(W(D4))` membership and the surrounding generalized-Birkhoff/convex-geometric theorem.

### Nested all-rank lower witness

Lean file: `FormalResearch/QID/NestedLowerWitness.lean`.

PR #13 promoted head `a8d883584eb235fa2f1c4af0c01ec309cedfc0ac`, run `34378799353`, module and aggregate green; merged.

For `n=k+4`, Lean defines the actual block witness and proves `<N_n,A_n>=n+2/3`.

External boundary: generalized-Birkhoff nesting / semantic `A_n in DS(W(D_n))`.

### Nested all-rank upper decomposition

Lean files:

- `FormalResearch/QID/NestedUpperAtomicCore.lean`;
- `FormalResearch/QID/NestedUpperRankOneSums.lean`;
- `FormalResearch/QID/NestedUpperSupportBridge.lean`.

PR #14 module head `15ce8208c11f73b77fc2adbc4ad859f958cd031a`, run `34389943505`; promoted head `df4466a9e5b773db105bb1fcbd14945129d2a33b`, run `34390385283`; all modules and full aggregate green; merged.

Lean proves the exact source identity

`6N_n = 2R_n + 2C_n + sum_a s_a t_a^T`,

its explicit individual row/column rank-one expansion, the four opposite-parity sign atoms and the implication `<N_n,T><=n+2/3` from the individual sharp support bounds.

External boundary: the arbitrary-real type-D rearrangement / determinant-constrained Procrustes theorem supplying those sharp per-atom bounds. Together with the lower-witness boundary above, this is why the complete semantic `DS(W(D_n))` extremal theorem is not yet wholly internal Lean.

### D5 certificate chain

The maintained aggregate imports the D5 rank, enumeration, affine-rank, supporting-facet and full-facet certificate modules. The old theorem-map text saying these pieces were still pending is obsolete. For theorem semantics, consult the source-local QI-D certificate and module statements; aggregate compilation alone does not upgrade their external convex-geometric premises.

## Four-qubit average-entropy maximum (QIprojects PR 193, task T59)

Lean files: `FormalResearch/FourQubitEntropy/*.lean`; the source is
`ResearchNotes/QI/four_qubit_entropy/` (theorems `thm:fqe-moment`, `lem:fqe-purity`, `thm:fqe-entropy-max`).

The development is the Lean companion of QIprojects Paper E (`ResearchNotes/QI/four_qubit_entropy/`) and is developed
here; QIprojects holds no Lean source. Beyond the entropy maximum below it contains the equality case, one-cut rigidity,
the cubic-majorant criterion, Tsallis/Rényi bounds with equality, the HS/cluster crossing, convex-roof ceilings,
`Tradeoff.lean` (the `n = 4` purity–time-reversal tradeoff `π₂ ≥ 1/3 + τ/6`, optimal coefficient, three Bell-pairing zeros of
`F`), and `SevenQubitIcoState.lean` and `SevenQubitIcoPurity.lean` (the seven-qubit icosahedral coefficient tensor of `thm:ico`:
unit norm, maximally mixed one-qubit marginals, the purity polynomial of every three-qubit cut (35) and pair (21)
derived from the tensor, the mean three-body purity `121/917 + (1048/525)(x−37/524)²` on the family with unique minimum at
`x = 37/524`, and the cut and pair purities there; `SevenQubitIcoCert.lean`/`SevenQubitIcoSpectrum.lean`: the spectrum of
every three-qubit cut, `(4α²)⁶,(3α²+β²)²` avoiding the special site and `8α²,(4α²)⁵,(α²+β²)²` containing it;
`SevenQubitIcoEntropy.lean`: the mean three-body entropy of the family is strictly concave with a unique maximiser strictly
between `0` and `37/524`; the pair spectra and the numerical value of the maximiser are not formalized). Kernel `decide +kernel` only; no compiler axiom.

Formalized, with no `sorry`:

- `sexticF_ge`, `sexticF_nonneg` (`MomentInequality.lean`): for every `ψ ∈ (ℂ²)^{⊗4}`,
  `F = 17nP − 12T − 12n³ ≥ (15/32) n W₁ ≥ 0`, with `P`, `T` the summed purities and cubic moments of the
  three `1j` marginals (`Matrix.trace` of the reduced matrices) and `W₁` the squared Pauli expectations. The
  proof is the identity `1152 F = 540 n W₁ + 3 Σᵢ 36‖Rᵢ‖²` for the residual tensors `Rᵢ = 2Vᵢ − 19Uᵢ` of the
  swap derivation (`Generic.lean`), checked as an identity of 32-variable polynomials (`Identity.lean`) and
  transported to all complex states (`Transfer.lean`, `Defect.lean`, `Bridge.lean`).
- `purity_ge` (`Purity.lean`): `P ≥ n²` from `2P = 2n² + W₁ + τ`, `τ = |ψᵀ ε^{⊗4} ψ|²`.
- `negMulLog_le_hermCubic` (`HermiteBound.lean`): `−x ln x ≤ a x³ + b x² + c x + d` for `x ≥ 0`.
- `meanEntropy_le`, `meanEntropy_M4`, `meanEntropy_M4_max` (`Entropy.lean`, `Attainment.lean`): for a unit
  vector the mean von Neumann entropy of the three `1j` marginals (from `Matrix.IsHermitian.eigenvalues`) is at
  most `1 + log 3 / (2 log 2)`, and `M₄` attains it.

- `meanEntropy_eq_max_iff` (`EqualityMain.lean`): for a unit vector, mean entropy `= 1 + log 3 / (2 log 2)` iff
  `ψ` is a local-unitary image of `M₄` or of `conj M₄`. Forward: equality forces `P = 1` (`EqualityReduction.lean`),
  hence `W₁ = 0` and `ψᵀ ε^{⊗4} ψ = 0`, and the cut-`12` quadratic `(R-1/6)(R-1/2)=0`; `classify`
  (`ClassifyMain.lean`) then normalises `ψ` by explicit local unitaries (magic basis, block form, Euler
  rotations; `Magic`…`Normalize`, `Classify`). Converse: `EqualityConverse.lean`. `LUEquiv` is `∃` unitary
  `a,b,c,d` with `localApply a b c d ψ = φ` (`LocalUnitary.lean`).

- `Checks.lean`: non-vacuity and corollaries. Concrete evaluations of `normSqPsi, P, T, W₁, F` on `|0000⟩`
  (`3, 3, 4, F = 3`), the two-Bell-pair state (`P = 3/2, T = 9/8, W₁ = 0, F = 0`) and the cluster state
  (`P = 1, T = 3/8, W₁ = 0, F = 1/2`); `purity_identity_exact` (`2P = 2n² + W₁ + |ψᵀ ε^{⊗4} ψ|²`, `τ` identified);
  `purity_eq_one_iff` (unit: `P = 1 ↔ W₁ = 0 ∧ ψᵀ ε^{⊗4} ψ = 0`); `sexticF_zero_bloch` (unit and `F = 0` forces
  `W₁ = 0`); `cubicMoment_le_line` (`T ≤ 5/12 + 17/12 (P − 1)`) with `bell2_on_line` (sharp at `(3/2, 9/8)`);
  `tsallis2_le` and `cluster4_tsallis2_max` (mean Tsallis-2 entropy `≤ 2/3`, attained); `M4_invariants`
  (`P = 1, T = 5/12, F = 0, W₁ = 0` for `M₄`); `one_cut_rigidity_12` (unit, `P = 1` and the quadratic on cut
  `12` give `LUEquiv M₄ ψ ∨ LUEquiv (conj M₄) ψ`). `#guard_msgs` pins four of these to the standard axioms.

Trust boundary: the sextic polynomial identity `sexticDefect_check` is decided by `native_decide`, so it rests
on the compiler as well. A kernel-only run of the whole identity needs more than 7 GB: kernel memory grows
with the number of reduction steps (about 50 KB per step, never evicted within one declaration), and `Fgen`
alone peaks near 6 GB. The purity identity is a kernel `decide`. `#print axioms` of `meanEntropy_le`,
`meanEntropy_eq_max_iff`, `sexticF_ge`, `cubicMoment_le_line` and `M4_invariants` lists only `propext`,
`Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound` and that `native_decide` axiom; `purity_ge`, `purity_identity_exact`,
`purity_eq_one_iff` and `one_cut_rigidity_12` use only the standard three. Compiled evaluation of the same
identity takes about 0.5 GB. Not formalized: the zero-set classification of `F`, one-cut rigidity for cuts
`13` and `14`, the spectral majorant proposition, κ-sharpness beyond the one data point, and the
Tsallis (`q < 2`), Rényi and convex-roof corollaries.

## Gaudin, Racah and bridge modules

The maintained aggregate also imports the current Gaudin metric/rank chain, Racah Weyl-cell modules and B2/Blaschke bridge modules. They are compiled as part of the current aggregate. This high-level map does not attempt to restate every theorem in those families; use the Lean source and theorem-local project updates for exact scope.

## Next source-authorized finite targets

At the current handoff, the cleanest exact candidates are:

1. QI-D T33 exceptional F4 facet representative certificate;
2. QI-D T33 E6/F4 A2 envelope-to-quartic reduction;
3. QI-A T07 finite coding/guessing lemmas with faithful operational hypotheses;
4. the general type-D support/Procrustes bridge if sufficient real-linear-algebra infrastructure is developed.

QI-D T48 and the QI-B B4 flagship remain open research problems, not current theorem-completion targets.
